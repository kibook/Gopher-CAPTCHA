Gopher CAPTCHA API
==================

Checking if an IP is verified
-----------------------------

To check if an IP is verified, make a request to:

gopher://khzae.net/0/captcha/check[<TAB or ?><IP>]

If the optional parameter <IP> is omitted, the verification status
of the client making the request is returned.

The response will be the UNIX timestamp when the verification of
the specified IP expires, or 0 if it has already expired.

Example:

$ curl gopher://khzae.net/0/captcha/check?123.456.78.9
1582563368


Getting verified
----------------

To become verified, a user must visit:

gopher://khzae.net/1/captcha/test
